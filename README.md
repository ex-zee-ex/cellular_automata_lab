# cellular_automata_lab
a small program for experimenting with cellular automata built in openFrameworks
if you are running a Video_Waaaves Distro https://github.com/ex-zee-ex/VIDEO_WAAAVES_2 you can just download this project folder and add to apps-myApps, run the Project Generator and import this folder, then select open in IDE after it is imported and have fun.  If running in a regular old openFrameworks scenario you'll need the ofxImGui addon installed https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui
