if you have never used oF and/or Xcode before here are some troubleshooting tips to try before contacting me
1. the entire folder structure needs to be intact and moved into the apps/myApps folder within the openframeworks folder
2. try running project generator and importing this folder (with the abovementioned addons) if theres still errors
3. https://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/ has some advice on how to troubleshoot troublesome addons as well so check this out too!
